              Ms Veasey, who represented herself, said video evidence showed 27
              people in her home but maintained it was not a party. She admitted
              she was in the wrong for inviting people from outside her
              household to the property, which she shared with seven other
              people. She added she would have paid a smaller fine but felt the
              Â£10,000 fine was unjust. "It seems like a bit of a con. They're
              trying to pull money out of people, pushing people through court
              cases," she said.
